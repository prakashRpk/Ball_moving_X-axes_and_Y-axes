# Bouncing Ball Animation

This is a simple web project that demonstrates a ball bouncing within a `600x600` container using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [here](#).

## Features

- A ball that moves and bounces within a boundary.
- Dynamic movement of the ball controlled by JavaScript.
- Adjustable speed and smooth animations.
- Customizable ball colors and styles with CSS.

## How It Works

This project uses basic web technologies:
- **HTML** to structure the page.
- **CSS** to style the ball and the container.
- **JavaScript** to control the ball's movement using a simple physics model (with velocity and position updates).

### Main Concepts
1. The ball's position is updated periodically using the `setInterval` function.
2. The ball's velocity is reversed when it hits the boundaries of the container to make it "bounce."

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bouncing-ball.git
   cd bouncing-ball
   open index.html
   
Usage

To adjust the speed or appearance of the ball:

Change the time variable in the JavaScript code to control the speed of the animation.
Modify the CSS styles in the createBall function to customize the size or color of the ball.
